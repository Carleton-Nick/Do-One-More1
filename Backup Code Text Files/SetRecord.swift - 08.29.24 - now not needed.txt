SetRecord.swift

I am backing this up because I am going to delete this file in the system.  I am getting an error about ambiguity for the struct SetRecord.  I believe it's because it is being defined both in this file and in the new Exercise.swift file that is handing the new and optional variables for the metrics picker when you create a new exercise.  Anyway, this is a backup before I delete.

struct SetRecord: Hashable, Codable {
    var weight: String?
    var reps: Int?
    var elapsedTime: String?  // Optional field for elapsed time
    var distance: String?     // Optional field for distance
    var calories: String?     // Optional field for calories
    var custom: String?       // Optional field for custom notes
}
